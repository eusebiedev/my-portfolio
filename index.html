I'm currently enrolled in the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at <strong><a href="https://www.epicodus.com/" title="Visit Epicodus for more information">Epicodus</a></strong>  here in Portland, OR.

    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>For the past 7 years I worked for a small specialist electronic music instrument shop here in Portland, OR. Focused on: educating individuals and sometimes small groups on usage, implementation and build-out of unique instruments, as well as technical support for hardware and software.</p>
    <p>I have worked in  audio engineering, on stage and in the studio. Provided technical cue-based composition and live sound during rehearsals and performances using various software and hardware for local and touring theatre companies.</p>
    <p>I want to enter the world of software development and work in an exciting field. 
    Whether analog or electronic, software is paramount in the process of creating music. Combined with my experience in music, electronic instruments and the technical skills gained through the Epicodus bootcamp, I plan to eventually obtain a career programming for music software, web based music implementation, mobile apps, and real time applications for the arts.</p>
