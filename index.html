      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hello, I'm Eusebie Siebenberg, an aspiring Software Developer who also performs live electronic music as <strong>SunFalls</strong>. I'm currently enrolled in the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> here in Portland, OR. After many years in sales, I decided it was time for a career change and decided to try my hand at coding, turns out I love it! Combined with my years of experience in programming, technical support, usage and build out of custom music software and hardware, learning to code is the perfect match!</p>
