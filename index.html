    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Eusebie Siebenberg, an aspiring Software Developer who also performs live electronic music as <strong><a href="https://sunfalls.org" title="Visit my music blog">SunFalls</a></strong>. I'm currently enrolled in the Full Stack Coding Bootcamp at <strong><a href="https://www.epicodus.com/" title="Visit Epicodus for more information">Epicodus</a></strong>  here in Portland, OR. After many years in sales, I decided it was time for a career change and decided to try my hand at coding, turns out I love it! Combined with my years of experience in programming, technical support, usage and build out of custom music software and hardware, learning to code is the perfect match!</p>
